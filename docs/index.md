## Lesson overview

!!! overview ""
    :fontawesome-regular-bookmark: **Description**  
    Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world. It helps us understand what changes we made in the past and why we did a specific analysis in the way we did it. It is also vital for smooth collaboration where different people work on the same code simultaneously. Using version control for your research project means that your work is totally transparent, and because all your actions are recorded, it enables others to reproduce your studies.

    In this series, we will cover the basics of using Git with the GUI provided in PyCharm. Git is a open source, free of charge, and powerful version control tool, and we will demonstrate the few simple steps to boost your code organisation and reproducibility, all without the need of command line knowledge. We will then use GitHub to host and share our scripts, and show hands-on examples of how GitHub can facilitate code collaboration.
